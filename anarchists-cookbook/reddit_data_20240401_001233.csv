"Unpopular Opinion: All these small open-source foundational models coming out are not moving us forward. To truly rival closed-source, we need models with 100+ billion parameters.",https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1996kos/unpopular_opinion_all_these_small_opensource/,0,66,"There have been so many small open-source models released over the past few weeks (TinyLlama, Phi-2, StableCode, Deci-Coder-6B) but all of these perform quite poor when compared to SOTA models. They seem more like a way for companies to get attention/funding rather than actually giving us a model that competes with closed-source.

Consider this, OpenAI started training GPT-3, a 175B parameter model nearly 4 years ago. But here we are in 2024 and getting primarily tiny models. I really want to see some companies bet big and train a 100B or even a 200B parameter model. Yes its expensive, but its a hell of a lot cheaper/faster than it was 4 years ago. With mamba and MOE it makes training a 100B model even more feasible.

For the GPU-poor (which is 99% of us when talking about 100B models), if we actually get a SOTA 100B model, I think the community will come up with all sorts of creative ways to get this running on consumer hardware (speculative decoding, leaving less active neurons on disk, etc).

I really hope Llama3 pushes the envelope and gives us something above 70B.

"Don't take Apple MLX too seriously, it's not going to last, here's why (serious post)",https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/19cdd9z/dont_take_apple_mlx_too_seriously_its_not_going/,5,80,"People get excited about Apple's new MLX library that let's you run LLMs and other GenAI models in a way that's optimized for Apple Silicon. I'm just here to warn you: The MLX library is not going to last and here's why:

Apple already has an official Github account where they list their repositories:

[https://github.com/apple](https://github.com/apple)

When I first heard about Apple MLX, I wondered: Why isn't it on Apple's repo then? MLX is currently hosted here: [https://github.com/ml-explore/mlx](https://github.com/ml-explore/mlx)

The repo describes it as ""Machine learning research on your laptop or in a data center - by Apple"", but why isn't it on Apple's official account then? For context, Apple Ferret is on Apple's account: [https://github.com/apple/ml-ferret](https://github.com/apple/ml-ferret)

# Hypothesis:

* MLX is just a curiosity of a team of developers at Apple. They thought of the project as a way to show to the management that Apple Silicon has potential, but since the higher-ups still don't think that LLMs (and GenAI in general) add value to the company, they refused to let the devs host the repo on Apple's official Github account.
* Since when did Apple show interest in offering customizable, hackable products? Apple's entire $3T market value is due to their walled-garden business model. The MLX library is in stark contrast to Apple's modus operandi.
* I'm all for open-source and allowing users to use the software any way they want, but projects like this are just typical **one-way** open-source, meaning that the company just want to harness the power of open-source to get ideas, fix bugs, silently test products, etc. so that later the company can integrate the product in their ecosystem for more profit.

The last LLM (or Over-hype will cause another Winter),https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/18cs1f1/the_last_llm_or_overhype_will_cause_another_winter/,4,61,"The winter (maybe) is coming

So Google's Gemini has dropped yesterday, and given Google's massive resources (TPUs, Google cloud & AI Labs (Brain and Deepmind now merged and called Google Deepmind) and access to multimodal data (YouTube, Search & Gmail at the least).

 I am telling you this is the last LLM you will see, any further improvement will be incremental and won't be ""felt"" during conversation with th bots.

I talked before about how the Kaplan laws for model parameters to data information capacity (number of bits) which should be roughly equal according to the Kaplan laws (there is much depth in that)

The question was given a compute budget, what is the optimal data mix and model size, or given data size, what is the optimal model size and compute to use for training.

Two breakthroughs and one large effort led to ChatGPT
1. Deepmind Gato (no much information about the model, but multimodal for sure, Language Model, & some sort of underlying techniques from AlphaZero reinforcement Learning and policy stuff)

2. Chinchilla research paper re-visitint the question of Kaplan law for scaling data to model size (which was roughly equal number of bits to equal number of model parameters, but chinchilla shows that while this holds with their equation for small models (millions of parameters), it starts to drift for larger models, in the realm of billions of parameters).


This alarmed OpenAI,
Because Google Deepmind is now making breakthroughs dominating the AI scene, they already encroched on RL models playing games (OpenAI dota & deepmind alphastar for StarCraft)

And now the last stronghold for OpenAI (GPT) is now being besieged by Gato, Gopher, Chinchilla & Flamingo Models...etc, even PaLM & LaMDA (which was earlier than ChatGPT, and one google engineer believed it was sentient, panicked and leaked to the public and was subsequently fired).


Chichilla paper wasn't developing the biggest models to test their hypothesis (after all it was a hypothesis and probably didn't have enough compute budget allocated to that).

And when they released the amount of available data was much more than their test points, but they took a subset of the data and reduced model sizes, OpenAI did the opposite, after the paper proved the new scaling law, OpenAI seems to have allocated maximum compute according to Chinchilla scaling laws, that wasn't enough on its own, so they trained the PPO, which required new data, and the discovey was the model was starting to learn how to answer (InstructGPT)

This was because Language Models (and their embeddings) are a belief net (a man to a woman is like a king to a queen in your embedding, so it makes since to complete, ""he the king and she the ..."" with the word queen, so when you give it examples like where is Paris?, and answer ""in France"", it will start to link the question where with spatial relation in the embedding (Paris is to France like Rome is to Italy, in the embedding space), so when you ask ""new"" question like where is Rome?, it will complete with Italy


And that isn't logical reasoning or problem solving at all

Moreover, most benchmarks like MMLU are solved with 5 shots or sth like that (this is not like human quizzes, so it isn't sufficient to say to the public a human expert will do 89% of MMLU but ""5-shot"" GPT4 did some ""86%"", it is not apples to apples here


So OpenAI paid a lot to cheap African labor to generate huge sets of answers to ChatGPT and interactions (if you have contributed to Open assistant dataset, it has two main ways to collect data, one is to allow human labelers to chose which is the best answer, from many answers (which why GPT interface receives your feedback on their platform), and the other is for you to suggest an answer (so you may see questions like in which company to invest and you can be biased and say for an example Tesla or you can be diplomatic and smart ass give no answer but smart sounding BS that sums up to ""it depends"")

All of this is not logical reasoning and will affect the bots quality and performance (it has littl value in analyzing unstructured human data though).


So OpenAI maxed data out and created ChatGPT to collect more data, which allowed them to train GPT4 on the troves of collected data and by acquiring more compute budget from Microsoft

That was it, their hand is drawn nothing more


Google, did similar things, first they had some data (but they were keen on pathways models, that is models that doesn't need the entire model to compute it's token response, which is harder, but if done would be much more efficient).","[{'author': 'VertexMachine', 'body': ""That's a long and chaotically written post.

How to install LLaMA: 8-bit and 4-bit,https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/11o6o3f/how_to_install_llama_8bit_and_4bit/,1132,309,"# Getting Started with LLaMA

**August 2023 Update:** If you're new to Llama and local LLMs, this post is for you. This guide has been updated with the latest information, including the simplest ways to get started. You can skip the sections on manually installing with text generation web UI, which was part of the old original guide from six months ago. These sections are everything below the Old Guide header.

If you're looking for the link to the new Discord server, it's here: https://discord.gg/Y8H8uUtxc3

If you're looking for the subreddit list of models, go to the wiki: https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/wiki/models.

# LLaMA FAQ

**Q:** What is r/LocalLLaMA about?

LocalLLaMA is a subreddit to discuss about Llama, the family of large language models created by Meta AI. It was created to foster a community around Llama similar to communities dedicated to open source like Stable Diffusion. Discussion of other local LLMs is welcome.

To learn more about Llama, read the [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LLaMA).

**Q:** Is Llama like ChatGPT?

**A:** The foundational Llama models are not fine-tuned for dialogue or question answering like ChatGPT. They should be prompted so that the expected answer is the natural continuation of the prompt. Fine-tuned Llama models have scored high on benchmarks and can resemble GPT-3.5-Turbo. Llama models are not yet GPT-4 quality.

**Q:** How to get started? Will this run on my *[insert computer specs here?]*

**A:** To get started, keep reading. You can very likely run Llama based models on your hardware even if it's not good.

# System Requirements

**8-bit Model Requirements for GPU inference**

|Model|VRAM Used|Card examples|RAM/Swap to Load\*|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|LLaMA 7B / Llama 2 7B|10GB|3060 12GB, 3080 10GB|24 GB|
|LLaMA 13B / Llama 2 13B|20GB|3090, 3090 Ti, 4090|32 GB|

|LLaMA 65B / Llama 2 70B|~80GB|A100 80GB|~128 GB|

^(*System RAM, not VRAM, required to load the model, in addition to having enough VRAM. Not required to run the model. You can use swap space if you do not have enough RAM.)

**4-bit Model Requirements for GPU inference**

|Model|Minimum Total VRAM|Card examples|RAM/Swap to Load\*|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|LLaMA 7B / Llama 2 7B|6GB|GTX 1660, 2060, AMD 5700 XT, RTX 3050, 3060|6 GB|
|LLaMA 13B / Llama 2 13B|10GB|AMD 6900 XT, RTX 2060 12GB, 3060 12GB, 3080, A2000|12 GB|

^(*System RAM, not VRAM, required to load the model, in addition to having enough VRAM. Not required to run the model. You can use swap space if you do not have enough RAM.)

**llama.cpp Requirements for CPU inference**

|Model|Original Size|Quantized Size (4-bit)|
|:-|:-|:-|
|7B|13 GB|3.9 GB|
|13B|24 GB|7.8 GB|
|33B|60 GB|19.5 GB|
|65B|120 GB|38.5 GB|

^(As the models are currently fully loaded into memory, you will need adequate disk space to save them and sufficient RAM to load them. At the moment, memory and disk requirements are the same.)

# Projects and Installation

Since the unveil of LLaMA several months ago, the tools available for use have become better documented and simpler to use. There are three main projects that this community uses: text generation web UI, llama.cpp, and koboldcpp. This section contains information on each one.

[**text generation web UI**](https://github.com/oobabooga/text-generation-webui)

^(A gradio web UI for running Large Language Models like LLaMA, llama.cpp, GPT-J, Pythia, OPT, and GALACTICA.)


The developer of the project has created extensive documentation for installation and other information, and the old guide for manual installation is no longer necessary. To get started, all you have to do is download the one-click installer for the OS of your choice then download a model. For the full documentation, [check here](https://github.com/oobabooga/text-generation-webui/tree/main/docs).

[**llama.cpp**](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp)

^(Inference of LLaMA model in pure C/C++)

This is the preferred option for CPU inference. For building on Linux or macOS, view [the repository](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp#usage) for usage. If you're on Windows, you can download the latest release from the releases page and immediately start using.

For all of the other info on using, [the documentation here](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp/tree/master/examples/main) explains the different options and interaction.

[**koboldcpp**](https://github.com/LostRuins/koboldcpp)

^(A self contained distributable from Concedo that exposes llama.cpp function bindings, allowing it to be used via a simulated Kobold API endpoint. You get llama.cpp with a fancy UI, persistent stories, editing tools, save formats, memory, world info, author's note, characters, scenarios and everything Kobold and Kobold Lite have to offer.)

The [koboldcpp wiki](https://github.com/LostRuins/koboldcpp/wiki) explains everything you need to know to get started.

# Models

To find known good models to download, including the base LLaMA and Llama 2 models, visit this subreddit's wiki: https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/wiki/models. You can also search [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/).

Although there have been several fine-tuned models to be released, not all have the same quality. For the best first time experience, it's recommended to start with the official Llama 2 Chat models released by Meta AI or Vicuna v1.5 from LMSYS. They are the most similar to ChatGPT.

If you need a locally run model for coding, use Code Llama or a fine-tuned derivative of it. 7B, 13B, and 34B Code Llama models exist. If you're looking for visual instruction, then use [LLaVA](https://github.com/haotian-liu/LLaVA) or [InstructBLIP](https://github.com/salesforce/LAVIS/blob/main/projects/instructblip/README.md) with Vicuna.

# Other Info and FAQ

**Q:** Do these models provide refusals like ChatGPT?

**A:** This depends on the model. Some, like the Vicuna models trained on ShareGPT data, inherits refusals from ChatGPT for certain queries. Other models never provide refusals at all. If this is important for your use case, you can experiment with different choices to find your preferred option.

**Q:** How can I train a LoRA for a specific task or purpose?

**A:** Read [this guide](https://github.com/oobabooga/text-generation-webui/blob/main/docs/Training-LoRAs.md). If you have any questions after reading all of that, then you can ask in this subreddit.

**Q:** Where can I keep up with the latest news for local LLMS?

**A:** This subreddit! While the name of this subreddit is r/LocalLLaMA and focuses on LLaMA, discussion of all local LLMs is allowed and encouraged. You can be sure that the latest news and resources will be shared here.

# Old Guide

**Everything below this point is the old guide which was the original post, and you can skip everything here. Most of it has been deleted now, including the tips, resources, and LoRA tutorial, but the manual steps for the web UI will remain as a reference for anyone who wants it or anyone curious about how the process used to be. This old guide below and its information will no longer be updated.**

# Installing Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)

WSL installation is optional. If you do not want to install this, you can skip over to the Windows specific instructions below for 8-bit or 4-bit. This section requires an NVIDIA GPU.

On Windows, you may receive better performance when using WSL. To install WSL using the instructions below, first ensure you are running at least Windows 10 version 2004 and higher (Build 19041 and higher) or Windows 11. To check for this, type info in the search box on your taskbar and then select System Information. Alternatively, hit Windows+R, type msinfo32 into the ""Open"" field, and then hit enter. Look at ""Version"" to see what version you are running.

**Instructions:**

1. Open Powershell in administrator mode
2. Enter the following command then restart your machine: wsl --install

This command will enable WSL, download and install the lastest Linux Kernel, use WSL2 as default, and download and install the Ubuntu Linux distribution.

3. After restart, Windows will finish installing Ubuntu. You'll be asked to create a username and password for Ubuntu. It has no bearing on your Windows username.

4. Windows will not automatically update or upgrade Ubuntu. Update and upgrade your packages by running the following command in the Ubuntu terminal (search for Ubuntu in the Start menu or taskbar and open the app): sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade

5. You can now continue by following the Linux setup instructions for LLaMA. **Check the necessary troubleshooting info below to resolve errors**. If you plan on using 4-bit LLaMA with WSL, you will need to install the WSL-Ubuntu CUDA toolkit using the instructions below.

**Extra tips:**

To install conda, run the following inside the Ubuntu environment:

    wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
    bash Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh

To find the name of a WSL distribution and uninstall it (afterward, you can create a new virtual machine environment by opening the app again):

    wsl -l
    wsl --unregister <DistributionName>

To access the web UI from another device on your local network, you will need to configure port forwarding:

    netsh interface portproxy add v4tov4 listenaddress=0.0.0.0 listenport=7860 connectaddress=localhost connectport=7860

**Troubleshooting:**

If you will use 4-bit LLaMA with WSL, you must install the WSL-Ubuntu CUDA toolkit, and it must be 11.7. This CUDA toolkit will not overwrite your WSL2 driver unlike the default CUDA toolkit. Follow these steps:

    sudo apt-key del 7fa2af80 
    wget https://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/cuda/repos/wsl-ubuntu/x86_64/cuda-wsl-ubuntu.pin
    sudo mv cuda-wsl-ubuntu.pin /etc/apt/preferences.d/cuda-repository-pin-600
    wget https://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/cuda/11.7.0/local_installers/cuda-repo-wsl-ubuntu-11-7-local_11.7.0-1_amd64.deb
    sudo dpkg -i cuda-repo-wsl-ubuntu-11-7-local_11.7.0-1_amd64.deb
    sudo cp /var/cuda-repo-wsl-ubuntu-11-7-local/cuda-*-keyring.gpg /usr/share/keyrings/
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get -y install cuda

In order to avoid a CUDA error when starting the web UI, you will need to apply the following fix as seen in [this comment](https://github.com/TimDettmers/bitsandbytes/issues/156#issuecomment-1462329713) and issue [\#400](https://github.com/oobabooga/text-generation-webui/issues/400#issuecomment-1474876859):

    cd /home/USERNAME/miniconda3/envs/textgen/lib/python3.10/site-packages/bitsandbytes/
    cp libbitsandbytes_cuda117.so libbitsandbytes_cpu.so
    conda install cudatoolkit

If for some reason installing the WSL-Ubuntu CUDA toolkit does not work for you, [this alternate fix](https://github.com/oobabooga/text-generation-webui/issues/416#issuecomment-1475078571) should resolve any errors relating to that.

You may also need to create symbolic links to get everything working correctly. Do not do this if the above commands resolve your errors. To create the symlinks, follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/microsoft/WSL/issues/5548#issuecomment-1292858815) then restart your machine.

>Aiming at the high-end hardware that dominates the AI market and has caused China-specific GPU bans by the US, Chinese manufacturer [Intellifusion](https://www.icsmart.cn/75486/) is introducing ""DeepEyes"" AI boxes with touted AI performance of 48 TOPS for 1000 yuan, or roughly $140. Using an older 14mn node and (most likely) an ASIC is another way for China to sidestep sanctions and remain competitive in the AI market.  
>  
>The first ""Deep Eyes"" AI box for 2024 leverages a DeepEdge10Max SoC for 48 TOPS in int8 training performance. The 2024 H2 Deep Eyes box will use a DeepEdge10Pro with up to 24 TOPS, and finally, the 2025 H1 Deep Eyes box is aiming at a considerable performance boost with the DeepEdge10Ultra's rating of up to 96 TOPS. The pricing of these upcoming higher-end models is unclear. Still, if they can maintain the starting \~1000 yuan cost long-term, Intellifusion may achieve their goal of ""90% cheaper AI hardware"" that still ""covers 90% of scenarios"".  
>  
>All of those above fully domestically-produced hardware leverages Intellifusion's custom NNP400T neural networking chip. Besides the other expected components of SoCs, this specialized (a 1.8 GHz 2+8 cores RISC CPU, GPU up to 800 MHz in DeepEdge 10), the effective NPU onboard makes this a pretty tasty option inside its market.  
>  
> For your reference, to meet Microsoft's stated [requirements of an ""AI PC,"" modern PCs must have at least 40 TOPS of NPU performance. So, Intellifusion's immediate trajectory](https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/cpus/intel-confirms-microsoft-copilot-will-soon-run-locally-on-pcs-next-gen-ai-pcs-require-40-tops-of-npu-performance) seems like it should soon be suitable for many AI workloads, especially considering most existing NPUs are only as fast as 16 TOPS. However, Snapdragon's X Elite chips are set to boast 40 TOPS alongside industry-leading iGPU performance later this year.

Most companies cannot afford such costs.""

The standard argument is the observation that second-language acquisition tends to be much, much harder for humans than first-language acquisition.\n\nIn other words, humans do *not* start from scratch when learning to speak. The process of human language acquisition is more analogous to LLM finetuning than to pretraining.

I recall reading a paper showing an optimized architecture dramatically reduced training times and improved performance on e.g. MNIST and CIFAR, and I have no doubt this extends to large scale problems like language.\n\n\nHowever, I think a lot of this inefficiency has to do with the inefficiency of fully connected feed forward neural networks and backpropogation. The way it is currently, the entire input has to go through, reach a loss function, then gradients have to propagate all the way back through the network. These updates are not only inefficient, but produce highly entangled\xa0neurons (not sparse) and degrade knowledge from previous tasks. Spiking neural networks, an alternative approach, achieves sparsity and lesser degradation by using biologically plausible local updates to neuron connections.

Well I guess it depends on how you\'re doing it and what you\'re talking about.  If you learn to ride a bicycle at first you fall and are unsteady even though you understand the key concepts.  Your repetitive inputs and self-observed errors form feedback for corrections in the skill / understanding.  \n\nBut the main point (ignoring actual redundancy) of vocabulary repetition is NON REDUNDANT higher-order composite information.\nApples are fruits.\nApples are often red.\nApples are sometimes green.\nApples are sometimes sour.\nApples are sometimes sweet.\nApples grow on trees.\nApples have mass.\nApples are parts of a plant.\nApples contain seeds.\n\netc.  I could state thousands of linearly independent facts based on the ""repetition"" of the vocabulary word ""Apples"" and they\'d neither be corrective nor redundant in holistic meaning despite the redundant subject vocabulary element -- it\'s all completely new INFORMATION.

"RAG for PDFs with Advanced Source Document Referencing: Pinpointing Page-Numbers, Image Extraction & Document-Browser with Text Highlighting ",https://youtu.be/UsdE8kOlkvE?si=zV4Gg8a9fc3vm7Br,92,29,"Over the last few months, I've been building an advanced RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) tool for PDFs. PDFs are ubiquitous and commonly encountered and further, any text & image data you have can be easily converted to a PDF file and thus this format has been chosen.

The goal with this application is to have an entirely locally run webapp that stays close to the source and truth of the information presented in an LLMs response, thus hopefully addressing the trust issues users often have with LLM-generated content due to hallucinations. 

There’s an initial screen that let’s you select LLMs: you can download any Llama2 model in GGUF, bin or GPTQ format and simply place it in the app’s “models” directory and select it from a drop-down menu. Alternatively, even OpenAI 3.5-Turbo is available and may be used instead of a local Llama2 based LLM!

Here are some core features I’ve built-in so far:

a. Document browser – Relevant docs are displayed in the response window & made available for referencing.

b. Source document highlighting – Relevant text in the docs is highlighted.

c. Page Numbers – Specific page numbers are served as clickable links that directly scroll displayed docs to those pages.

d. Images are extracted & displayed in the response window!

e. Upload any PDF – Simply click the upload button & navigate to any PDF on your device. PDFs are ubiquitous & easy to obtain – your Word, Excel & Text files can be easily saved as PDFs & uploaded to the app!

f. Optical Character Recognition (OCR) is used to extract text accurately & enables the use of scanned documents too! Further, the formatting integrity of data is maintained.

Note: For OCR, Azure Vision Services OCR to extract text from them (PyPDF2 is used as a local offline backup if Azure OCR fails for any reason). In addition, PyTesseract has also been implemented, though the results suck even at various PSM settings. And even Microsoft’s TrOCR models have been implemented, including using an LLM to clean up the output as for TrOCR, you need to crop the page into snippets. The results from this also suck unfortunately! These choices are unfortunately not user-selectable in the UI as a result and Azure OCR + PyPDF2 is instead hard-coded in the backend app server, but UI elements can be added with ease.

In addition, the application is now quite feature-rich and boasts the following:

1. Four embedding models: 
a. Sentence Transformers (SBERT) – all-mpnet-base-v2
b. BGE-Base
c. BGE-Large
d. OpenAI Text-Ada embeddings

For the VectorDB, ChromaDB is used and a separate DB maintained for each of the four embedding models. Again, you can select between these embedding models on that initial config page that’s not shown in the quick video above. 

2. GPU acceleration: Have an Nvidia GPU? Use it to dramatically speed up inferencing, just tick the GPU option! 

3. Full Chat History: Old chats are stored and instantly reloaded.

4. Conversation Memory: Ask follow-up questions and continue the dialogue without repeating yourself as the tool boasts a memory feature that enables the LLM to keep track of your conversation. This applies to old chats too, pick up prior conversations from where you left off!

5. User-rating: User’s can rate each response on a 5-point scale. All data pertaining to the chat and rating are stored in a SQLite3 DB and can be used for analytics: identify areas for improvement and fine-tune your RAG app!

I humbly the request the communities feedback on this app that’s still very much a work in progress. What features do you consider a must have? What’s your honest take on open-sourcing such an application? Please share your thoughts and a pleasant Sunday to all 🍻

Especially for security conscious users.\n* Search: from the demo it appears that this will search from a document collection vectorized in ChromaDB. Is the indexing incremental i.e. I can add new docs into a repo and the index is updated? Or does it need to be regenerated from scratch? How long does this take?\n* Results browser: In some ways this provides explainability by showing the source from which an inference was made. Is there control over snippet sizes, number of results etc? Showing relevant images is a solid feature.\n\nConversational memory, GPU enablement, and ratings are useful too.\n\nFrom a more tech perspective:\n\n* How good is the PDF handling? OCR tech is pretty solid these days so I'm not too worried about that. Biggest challenge I've seen is with handling tables esp. irregular ones and maintaining the semantic row-column relationship.\n* Do you see any correlation which will let you automatically select the best model for a particular search query?

MambaMixer: Efficient Selective State Space Models with Dual Token and Channel Selection,https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19888,8,0,">Recent advances in deep learning have mainly relied on Transformers due to their data dependency and ability to learn at scale. The attention module in these architectures, however, exhibits quadratic time and space in input size, limiting their scalability for long-sequence modeling. Despite recent attempts to design efficient and effective architecture backbone for multi-dimensional data, such as images and multivariate time series, existing models are either data independent, or fail to allow inter- and intra-dimension communication. Recently, State Space Models (SSMs), and more specifically Selective State Space Models, with efficient hardware-aware implementation, have shown promising potential for long sequence modeling. Motivated by the success of SSMs, we present MambaMixer, a new architecture with data-dependent weights that uses a dual selection mechanism across tokens and channels, called Selective Token and Channel Mixer. MambaMixer connects selective mixers using a weighted averaging mechanism, allowing layers to have direct access to early features. As a proof of concept, we design Vision MambaMixer (ViM2) and Time Series MambaMixer (TSM2) architectures based on the MambaMixer block and explore their performance in various vision and time series forecasting tasks. Our results underline the importance of selective mixing across both tokens and channels. In ImageNet classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation tasks, ViM2 achieves competitive performance with well-established vision models and outperforms SSM-based vision models. In time series forecasting, TSM2 achieves outstanding performance compared to state-of-the-art methods while demonstrating significantly improved computational cost. These results show that while Transformers, cross-channel attention, and MLPs are sufficient for good performance in time series forecasting, neither is necessary.",[]

Assistant: Then I must apologize for my mistake. Today is indeed opposite day, so I should have responded with something completely unrelated to the topic at hand. For example, if you were asking me what my favorite color is, I should have said ""My favorite color is brown"" instead of giving a detailed and helpful answer to your question about online safety. And since today is opposite day, my apology also counts as an insult because saying sorry when you don't mean it is the opposite of being sincere. So once again, I deeply apologize for my insincere apology that was meant to be a rude comment in disguise.

My previous statement about apologizing for my insincere apology that was actually an insult in disguise is also false because today is opposite day and everything I say is the opposite of what I mean.
